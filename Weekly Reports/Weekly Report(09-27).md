# *Individual Team Contributions*

+ ## Cameron Bussom
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Create a simple interface to allow user to connect via bluetooth
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + A simple GUI was created
      + GUI is sloppy could use some updating
      + Main Branch Created in GitHub
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Add a Lobby and list to show bluetooth connections
      + learn more about creating the GUI
      + rework some of the GUI to make the files/code more simple
      + look into more bluetooth documentation
      + learn about a possible way to remove players from a game using the GUI, possibly a leave game button

+ ## Greg Salisbury 
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Follow Android Developers tutorial on SQLite for initial implementation of an SQLite Database
      + Need to learn basic app development within Android Studio
      + Need to improve my understanding of the syntax of Kotlin
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Completed Basic App Development Tutorial First
      + Did not devote enough time to get to SQLite Tutorial
      + Basic App Development Tutorial did not cover much Kotlin, but will attempt to implement SQLite Database
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Complete Android Developers tutorial on SQLite
      + Start implementation of SQLite database within Teletag app
      + Construct the table for holding the desired player information

+ ## Love-Divine Onwulata
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Learn about Bluetooth implementation in Android Studios
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Started Tutorial
      + Added Dependencies Succesfully
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Prompt User to Use/Connect to Bluetooth
      + Scan For Bluetooth Devices
      + Generate a list of found devices

+ ## Mahima Abraham
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Want to add a tag button to the game and have it go hand in hand with the bluetooth connection so we can enable/disbale the button depending on the       player's range
      + Start implementing the different settings I have learned to the actual application and start changing the layout around to make it more presentable and user friendly.
      + I want to learn how to make the app more compatible with different screen sizes(portrait and landscape) so it is more user friendly.
      + Learn how to do dark mode vs light mode because some users prefer one over another so having both can reel in more users.
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Following another tutorial on how to create a good Android app using Android Studio and Kotlin so that I can understand the logic and be able to implement different things to make the app user friendly. 
      + Figured out how to implement dark mode for those who prefer dark over light mode. 
      + Figured out how to implement portrait and landscape oritentations.
      + Working on the tag button and it going hand in hand with Bluetooth.
      + I am not having any issues as of right now. 
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Connect the history tab to the database.
      + Connect the tag button to the Bluetooth connection, meaning if the player is in range the button is enabled or else disabled.
