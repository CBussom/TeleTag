+ ## Mahima Abraham
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Learn and become more familiar with Android Studio and Kotlin.
      + Learn different ways to customize the application to improve the layout
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + I watched tutorials on Android Studio and Kotlin to learn and get familier with the IDE and language and did a few small projects to understand how to use Android Studios and Kotlin. 
      + I created my own project with the phone application we have currently to play around with different settings of the app such as the layout, the different fonts, etc.
      + I am not having many issues right now. The one issue I encountered and resolved was when I downloaded Android Studio and the application was not running the code and having our app pop up. 
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Want to add a tag button to the game and have it go hand in hand with the bluetooth connection so we can enable/disbale the button depending on the player's range
      + Start implementing the different settings I have learned to the actual application and start changing the layout around to make it more presentable and user friendly.
      + I want to learn how to make the app more compatible with different screen sizes(portrait and landscape) so it is more user friendly.
      + Learn how to do dark mode vs light mode because some users prefer one over another so having both can reel in more users.
