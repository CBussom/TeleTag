1. Continue working on SQLite database - Greg Salisbury
2. Create columns for players - Cameron Bussom
3. Continue working on finding other devices using bluetooth - Love-Divine Onwulata and Cameron Bussom
4. Figure out how to have the tag button enabled/disabled depending on the player's range - Mahima Abraham

# *Individual Team Contributions*

+ ## Cameron Bussom
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Create a simple interface to allow user to connect via bluetooth
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + A simple GUI was created
      + GUI is sloppy could use some updating
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Add a Lobby and list to show bluetooth connections
      + learn more about creating the GUI
      + rework some of the GUI to make the files/code more simple
      + look into more bluetooth documentation
      + learn about a possible way to remove players from a game using the GUI, possibly a leave game 
      BLUETOOTH WORKING HIGHEST PRIORITY

+ ## Greg Salisbury 
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Complete Android Developers tutorial on SQLite
      + Start implementation of SQLite database within Teletag app
      + Construct the table for holding the desired player information
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Still need to complete tutorial
      + Once tutorial is completed, will start implementation and table construction
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Test whether database is working within Teletag App

+ ## Love-Divine Onwulata
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Learn about Bluetooth implementation in Android Studios
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Started Tutorial
      + Dataclass method issue
      + Found Github that implements bluetooth in Kotlin
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Learn from other GitHub repo to implement bluetooth.

+ ## Mahima Abraham
    + **Goals of last week:**
      + Want to add a tag button to the game and have it go hand in hand with the bluetooth connection so we can enable/disbale the button depending on the       player's range
      + Start implementing the different settings I have learned to the actual application and start changing the layout around to make it more presentable and user friendly.
      + I want to learn how to make the app more compatible with different screen sizes(portrait and landscape) so it is more user friendly.
      + Learn how to do dark mode vs light mode because some users prefer one over another so having both can reel in more users.
    + **Progress and Issues:**
      + Got through most of the tutorial for Kotlin and Android studio. 
      + Did research on how to have the tag button and Bluetooth connection go hand in hand and have started working on trying to implement it on my own project before I make any permanent changes to the actual app. 
      + I am not having any issues as of right now. 
    + **Next Week's Goals:**
      + Connect the history tab to the database.
      + Finish connecting the tag button to the Bluetooth connection, meaning if the player is in range the button is enabled or else disabled and apply it to the actual app.
      + Find more features to apply to the phone app to make it user friendly.
