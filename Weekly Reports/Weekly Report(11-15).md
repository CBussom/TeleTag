# *Team Report*

## Last Week's Goals:
1. Improving the GUI currently in place
2. Get the Bluetooth to work fully meaning fix the app from crashing whenever we click on a device to connect to.
3. Be able to connect to other devices and communicate between the two.
4. Make all ViewModels access data from 1 place
   
## Progress and Issues:
+ There are multiple views now
+ The App connects only to other app users
+ The app has a blutooth server
+ The app crashes on any emulator or device other than Cameron's android 8 device 


## This Week's Goals
1. Fix the bugs within the app so that it won't crash when the users are switching the views(peer review).
2. Get the app to run, without crashing, on other Android devices.
3. Get the connection up and running between the devices.
4. Edit SQLite code to create correct tables
